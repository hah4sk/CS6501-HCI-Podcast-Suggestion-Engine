140	Ep.5 - Where is Michael Negrete	 Solvable Mysteries Podcast	"How could a college student disappear in the middle of a crowded UCLA dormitory? This week on Solvable Mysteries we cover the mysterious and troubling disappearance of Michael Negrete, UCLA freshman, from his dorm room at UCLA?õÉ?™É?õs Dykstra Residential Hall in December of 1999, just before the winter break.  Almost 20 years later, there are few clues or theories to what happened to Michael and where he could be.   Welcome to Solvable Mysteries Podcast, hosted by Juras Sim and co-hosted by Glenn Highcove. During this episode we review the status of Michael Negrete?õÉ?™É?õs missing person case and review the evidence and theories that have come up in the almost 20 years since Michael went missing from the crowded, student-filled campus of UCLA.  We ask the question, ?õÉ?™è?How could someone completely disappear, without a trace, from a crowded dorm building, never to be found from again??õÉ?™?ù  We discuss theories to his disappearance, from the sinister (human trafficking, organ harvesting, abduction) to the tragic (suicide, psychological break, cutting ties with family and friends) to the possibility that a freak accident, maybe coupled with conspiracy, hid his body and his fate from the world and his family forever.

"	"In March 1584, Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, allowing him to explore and settle areas of the New World that had yet to be claimed by the Spanish. What followed were several disastrous attempts to form settlements, with colonists being met with shipwrecks, food shortages, hostile aboriginals, and disease. In 1587, Governor John White finally established what was supposed to be the first permanent English settlement in the New World at Roanoke Island. In August 1587, White was forced to leave the Roanoke colonists behind in order to sail back to England for supplies and reinforcements, and to inform the Queen about the complications the colonists had run into. A series of unfortunate events led to White being unable to return to the New World until 1590. Upon his return, White could find no trace of the colonists - what happened to the Roanoke colonists is still unknown today...On this episode of Big, If True, Matt and Kayla discuss the lost colony of Roanoke, including the history of colonization attempts, theories about what happened to the lost colonists of Roanoke, and much more."
